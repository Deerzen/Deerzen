## About Me

Hi, my name is Ole and I am a German developer with a wide range of interests and skills. My primary programming language is Python, and I have experience using tools such as Django, PostgreSQL, Godot, Git, Streamlit and Pandas.

I have primarily worked on data-driven applications and video game production, but I am also interested in exploring web development and databases. In addition to my general Python skills, I have gained experience with HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and CSS through a solo Django project where I created an online dictionary and community hub for Twitch emotes and their meanings.

I am always looking for opportunities to learn and improve my skills, and I am open to collaborating on interesting projects.

## Skills and Interests

* Python development
* Data analysis and visualization
* Video game production
* Web development (HTML, CSS, Django, Bootstrap)

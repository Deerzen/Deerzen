## 👋 Hey there, my name is Ole
I am a German developer who primarily uses Python for whatever piques my interest. This wide-spread interest in different topics and application scenarios is reflected in the repositories on my GitHub profile. Feel free to browse my repositories and ask any questions you might have.
Almost everything I know I have taught myself and the archieved skills have often proven to be useful. Primarily I have dealt with datadriven applications
and video game production. In the future I am looking forward to getting more into web development and databases. Certainly I have a lot to learn
and limited experience. However, I am confident that I can tackle my challenges ahead.

### 🐍 Looking to improve my Python & general development skills in collaborative projects
I am always interested in trying out new things and learning from more experienced developers.
This is why I am looking for opportunities to collaborate or contribute to interesting projects. I believe that working on real life projects
is the best way to learn and improve my skills.

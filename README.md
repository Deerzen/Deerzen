## 👋 Hey there, my name is Ole
I am a German developer who primarily uses Python for whatever piques my interest. This wide-spread interest in different topics and application scenarios is reflected in the repositories on my GitHub profile.
The first repo is a calculator that projects wealth growth and uses streamlit as a GUI. The second is a Client that connects to Twitch chat
and is able to analyse the current sentiment in realtime and can visualize the data.
The third is a private repository for a 2D pixel survival game that is being developed with the Godot engine and GDScript. I also made a simple 2D game with Pygame which was my first bigger project many years ago.
Beyond these projects I am currently developing an interface that enables people to easily communicate with OpenAI via voice. 

### 🐍 Looking to improve my Python skills in collaborative projects
I am always interested in trying out new things and learning from more experienced developers.
This is why I am looking for opportunities to collaborate or contribute to interesting projects. I believe that working on real life projects
is the best way to learn and improve my skills.
